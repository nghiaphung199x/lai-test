How to Upgrade
-------------------------
1. Replace all code from your point of sale installation with the code downloaded
2. Run the necessary database upgrades from the database folder. For example if you had
version 13.2 and are upgrading to 14.3 and would execute the following sql files in order:

database_13.2-14.0.sql
database_14.0-14.1.sql
database_14.1-14.2.sql
database_14.2-14.3.sql
